# Elevator

The elevator's current design requires a resident key to use the elevator. This makes it hard for guests or even residents if they happen to misplace their keys to get to where they are trying to go.

Without a key, hitting the elevator button will do nothing and the elevator will remain on the current floor. It is inconvient for the residents to have to take the elevator down to meet the guests just to bring them up to their apartment.
